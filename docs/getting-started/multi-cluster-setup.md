# Work with multiple clusters

Organizations are part of the cluster identifier and filesystem layout. The
repository workflow proves this form:

```bash
opencenter cluster init demo --org my-org --type kind
opencenter cluster use my-org/demo
```

Create another cluster under the same organization with a distinct name:

```bash
opencenter cluster init test --org my-org --type kind
```

List and inspect configurations:

```bash
opencenter cluster list
opencenter cluster describe my-org/demo
opencenter cluster describe my-org/test
```

Select the cluster for commands that use the active selection:

```bash
opencenter cluster use my-org/test
opencenter cluster active
```

Each cluster is validated and generated independently:

```bash
opencenter cluster validate my-org/demo
opencenter cluster generate my-org/demo
opencenter cluster validate my-org/test
opencenter cluster generate my-org/test
```

Use an explicit `org/cluster` identifier in automation to avoid depending on
the active marker. The global `--config-dir` option changes the root used by
the CLI; the workflow fixture uses it to isolate tests.

## Evidence and boundary

- Organization selection and active-marker paths: `tests/features/workflow.feature`
- Cluster commands: `cmd/cluster_list.go`, `cmd/cluster_use.go`,
  `cmd/cluster_describe.go`
- The checkout does not establish organization-wide defaults, shared secrets,
  automatic promotion, or a multi-cluster deployment outcome; those are not
  described here.
