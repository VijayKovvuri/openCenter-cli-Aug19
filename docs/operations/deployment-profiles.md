# Service enablement profiles

There is no discrete profile flag in the CLI. Service selection is represented
by each service's `enabled` field in the v2 configuration.

Inspect the available service state for a cluster:

```bash
opencenter cluster service status --cluster ORG/CLUSTER
opencenter cluster service options SERVICE --cluster ORG/CLUSTER
```

Enable or disable a service through the command surface:

```bash
opencenter cluster service enable SERVICE --cluster ORG/CLUSTER
opencenter cluster service disable SERVICE --cluster ORG/CLUSTER
```

The commands support service parameters and secrets through their documented
flags. They edit the cluster file; apply the change separately:

```bash
opencenter cluster validate ORG/CLUSTER
opencenter cluster generate ORG/CLUSTER
```

For a generated configuration, keep service YAML structural and use only typed
fields accepted by the schema. Do not add renderer metadata or assume that an
enabled service implies a live deployment.

## Evidence

- Service command surface: `cmd/cluster_service.go`
- Service defaults and typed fields: `internal/config/v2/services.go`,
  `internal/config/v2/defaults.go`
- Validation: `internal/config/v2/readiness.go`
