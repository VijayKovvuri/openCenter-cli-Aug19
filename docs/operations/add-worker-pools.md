# Add a worker pool

Worker pools are configuration entries. The pool command writes the v2
configuration; generation and deployment are separate operations.

## Add a pool

```bash
opencenter cluster pool add batch \
  --cluster ORG/CLUSTER \
  --count 2 \
  --flavor WORKER_FLAVOR
```

Supported add flags include `--image`, `--os linux|windows`,
`--boot-volume-size`, `--boot-volume-type`, repeatable `--label key=value`, and
repeatable `--taint key=value:effect`. `--flavor` is required.

The command stores Linux pools under
`opencenter.infrastructure.compute.additional_server_pools_worker` and Windows
pools under the corresponding `_windows` collection. These names are the
structural fields used by the implementation; provider-specific flavor, image,
and volume values are not invented by openCenter.

## Validate and apply the configuration

```bash
opencenter cluster validate ORG/CLUSTER
opencenter cluster generate ORG/CLUSTER
opencenter cluster deploy ORG/CLUSTER
```

Use global `--dry-run` on the mutating command when you want a preview.

## Evidence and limits

The command edits configuration and prints a reminder to generate. It does not
by itself prove that a provider has capacity or that a node joined Kubernetes.
Those checks require the provider lifecycle and a live cluster.
