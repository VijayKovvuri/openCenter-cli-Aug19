# Documentation maintenance

**Purpose:** For contributors and maintainers, explains where documentation
source lives, how pages are classified, and how to verify documentation
changes. This is a repository guide, not a claim about a published site.

## Boundaries

- [`docs/index.md`](index.md) is the canonical reader-facing source index.
- [`README.md`](../README.md) is the concise project entry point.
- [`llms.txt`](../llms.txt) is a code-oriented navigation aid; it should not
  duplicate the reader-facing index or generated command reference.
- [`CODEMAPS/INDEX.md`](CODEMAPS/INDEX.md) contains repository-internal code
  maps and is not reader-facing product documentation.
- [`docs/README.md`](README.md) is this maintenance guide.

The repository contains Markdown source. Do not describe a hosted site as
published unless repository configuration or release evidence establishes that
fact.

## Source layout and Diátaxis classification

Directories provide lifecycle navigation; they do not create a second set of
taxonomy folders. Each reader-facing page has one `doc_type` in its YAML
frontmatter:

| Source area | Classification | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `getting-started/` | `tutorial` | A guided first outcome |
| `operations/` | `how-to` | A task or operational procedure |
| `reference/` | `reference` | Structured facts, fields, commands, and options |
| `concepts/` | `explanation` | Context, rationale, and system behavior |
| `providers/` | Usually `reference` | Provider-specific facts and procedures |
| `contributing/` | Choose one per page | Developer procedures, facts, or explanations |
| `index.md`, `glossary.md` | `reference` | Navigation and terminology |
| `CODEMAPS/` | Internal explanation | Code maps; excluded from the reader-facing set |

Use the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/) to choose the page type,
but keep existing lifecycle directories. Do not create `tutorial/`,
`how-to/`, `reference/`, or `explanation/` taxonomy directories.

## Required page metadata

Reader-facing pages start with frontmatter containing:

```yaml
id: url-safe-slug
title: "Page title"
sidebar_label: Page title
description: One-sentence scope.
doc_type: tutorial | how-to | reference | explanation
audience: "specific audience"
tags: [at-least-one-tag]
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
```

Use exactly one `doc_type`. Begin the body with a `**Purpose:**` line that
states the audience and scope. Advance `last_updated` only for a substantive
change to meaning, instructions, or technical facts; do not advance it for a
link-only or formatting change.

`docs/README.md` and `docs/CODEMAPS/**` are explicitly excluded from the
default frontmatter audit because they are repository navigation material, but
this guide keeps metadata so contributors can classify it consistently.

## Maintenance workflow

1. **Find the source of truth.** Re-check code, configuration, tests, and CI
   before changing a technical claim. Prefer links to the detailed page over
   repeating a value in an index or navigation file.
2. **Choose the page type.** Apply one Diátaxis `doc_type`; keep the page in
   the lifecycle directory that readers already use.
3. **Update the page and its links.** Keep local links relative to the file,
   point to files rather than empty directory paths, and remove links to files
   that do not exist. Add `last_updated` for substantive changes.
4. **Regenerate generated command reference when needed.** If the built-in
   Cobra command tree changes, run `mise run docs-gen`. Do not hand-edit
   `reference/opencenter/`; the generator is `go run cmd/docs/generate.go`.
5. **Review the diff.** Confirm that examples, flags, provider boundaries,
   and links still match the source. Avoid copying generated command details
   into README, the index, or `llms.txt`.

## Checks

The repository-defined frontmatter audit is:

```bash
python3 hack/scripts/audit_doc_frontmatter.py --strict
# or, through mise:
mise run test-docs-frontmatter
```

The pull-request docs workflow audits changed Markdown files and runs Vale;
see [`.github/workflows/docs-p0.yml`](../.github/workflows/docs-p0.yml).
For generated command pages, use `mise run test-docs` after regeneration. This
is a repository-only check: it does not publish or deploy a documentation site.
Its Mermaid coverage is structural and fence-only; it does not render diagrams.

For the local full-package Go sweep, use `mise run test-go-all`. The task gives
each Go test run a 15-minute timeout and, on failure, writes a transient failure
log under `.tmp/` for diagnosis rather than keeping a repository artifact. This
sweep is separate from `mise run test:all`, the broader aggregate of the
repository's unit, race, vet, BDD, property, and vulnerability checks.

## Useful entry points

- [Reader-facing documentation index](index.md)
- [Project README](../README.md)
- [CLI command reference](reference/cli-commands.md)
- [Configuration schema](reference/configuration-schema.md)
- [Glossary](glossary.md)
